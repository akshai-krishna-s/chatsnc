                      Sree Narayana College, Kollam, is one of the pioneering centre of higher education in the state of Kerala, India. Affiliated to the University of Kerala, the college is managed
                      by the corporate management of Sree Narayana Trusts, Kollam. The college was initiated in 1948, an year after the historic Indian independence. At a time when the luminary vision
                      offered by education was considered expensive and unattainable, the founder of the college, Sri. R Sankar (1909- 1972), the former Chief Minister of Kerala, embarked on a
                      visionary mission of the establishment of a higher educational institution of national repute, especially catering to the educational requirements of the poor and the
                      downtrodden. The college is named after the internationally renowned philosopher, social reformer and mystic poet,
                      <a href="https://snckollam.ac.in/guiding-spirit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sree Narayana Guru</a> (1856 – 1928), whose preaching on social equality, societal reformation
                      and education brought out a tremendous impact upon the Kerala society, which might have otherwise been doomed with restrictions imposed by the miserable caste system or
                      Chaturvarnya. Inspiring enough, the college upholds the preaching’s of Guru, through its motto, “One caste, One Religion, One God for Man. ”Taking hold of an awakening social
                      consciousness for an imminent need of education, and the reformative and progressive moves of Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP), both propelled by the visionary
                      thoughts of Sree Narayana Guru; aided Sri. R Sankar in the establishment of the institution by the side of the historic Cantonment Maidan at Kollam.

                      The college initially offered only intermediate courses and was subsequently upgraded to a college offering Under Graduate programmes (in 1957) and finally Post Graduate
                      programmes. Currently, the college is one of the largest of its kind in Kerala state, offering 18 Under Graduate and 14 Post Graduate Programmes; besides, nine of its departments
                      offers research programmes. The college has recently initiated several utilitarian oriented Certificate Courses (both UGC approved and self-financed by the Departments of the
                      college) to usher in and ensure more public participation in educational ventures. The college boasts of a rich tradition in upholding the liberalist and humanitarian values and
                      this is much evident in the illustrious contribution in the discourses of socio political and cultural scenario, both within the state and in our nation. The extensive campus in
                      ten acres of prime land in the heart of Kollam city, houses sprawling buildings boasting modernist architecture. An exhaustive library and the lively presence of the district
                      IGNOU Centre and Kerala University Distance Education centre make it a thriving educational hub in Kollam District. A vibrant campus, the enriching environs, the historic
                      overtones, and the philosophic embodiment, combined with its strategic positioning near major rail road transit points make the college an attractive space to opt for, among the
                      stu- dent community. The college is NAAC accredited with ‘A’ Grade; besides being enlisted as an ‘A’ Band institution in Atal Ranking of Institutions, 2020.
