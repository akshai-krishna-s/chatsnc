      The department of mathematics is one of the pioneer departments of SN College, Kollam since its inception in 1948. Prof. K. Sudharma (Retired Professor and Head of the department Govt. Women’s
      College, Thiruvanathapuram) was appointed as the first faculty member of the department. Prof. P.I Varghese also joined the department in the same year. Degree course on Mathematics has been
      started in 1949. The first batch of two year degree students came out in 1951. During this period Prof. G. Ramachandra Iyer was the head of the department and the strength of the teaching
      faculty was raised to five. Prof. P.I Varghese took charge as head of the department during the academic year 1953-54. In the year 1956-57 one year pre-university course was introduced with
      mathematics as a compulsory subject along with other subjects instead of the existing two year intermediate course. With the introduction of M.Sc course in 1963, the department was achieved the
      status of a Post Graduate department. The first batch of 15 M.Sc students came out with outstanding performances. Sri. K. Gopinatha Pillai ( Retired Deputy Director of Collegiate Education)
      secured the first rank and Sri. Radhakrishnan Chettiar secured the third rank in the year of March 1965. Smt. S. Baby Saroja and Sri. G. Aravindakshan, the student of the first M.Sc batch became
      the heads of this department in later years.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The pre-university course was replaced by a two year pre-degree course with different optional subject groups. The university sanctioned 3 batches of 80 students in each batch in group 1 with
      Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry as optional subjects.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      In 1966 the University of Kerala has been reorganized the B.Sc course and some colleges were selected for starting special B.Sc course in various science subjects. Our department was selected
      and special B.Sc course was started during the academic year 1966-67 in addition to the general B.Sc degree course with statistics as subsidiary subject. After 3 years the University has changed
      its policy and all special B.Sc courses were stopped.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      We were introduced subsidiary Mathematics for B.A Economics (Main) and from 1988-89 onwards our department opted computer programming as an elective subject for B.Sc degree students. Mathematics
      was introduced as auxiliary subject for the PCA semester system started in 1998. Semester system was introduced in the post graduate course from 2001 admission onwards. The delinking of
      pre-degree course from colleges came to an end during 2001-02. All the pre-degree courses run in the colleges for the last 52 years were completely detached from the colleges during 2001-02.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      In 2010, CBCSS was introduced in the degree courses. In 2012 several changes happened and the degree course with marks, rank systems etc are abolished. In 2013, all students in degree courses
      came under CBCSS. Grade is awarded to students from 2010 admission onwards. From 2013 onwards earlier mark system re-introduced and now department is running with a systematic academic calendar.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">In 2019 March, a new Computer Lab was set up in the department funded by DST-FIST and PTA.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      In 2019 a Bridge course Topics in Mathematics was introduced for First year students, FDP in Economics to bridge the gap between subject studied at pre-university level and subject they would be
      studying at university level.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      In 2020 due to pandemic Covid-19 online classes were introduced and one semester was completed using various online platforms like Google classroom, Google meet, YouTube etc.

      Mathematics is one of the most useful and fascinating divisions of human knowledge .It includes many topics of study. Because of this reason, the term Mathematics is difficult to define. It
      comes Greek word meaning” inclined to learn”.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Computing is the solving of Mathematical problems that involve much work with numbers.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The important skills in Mathematics are careful analysis and clear reasoning. These skills can help people to solve some of the deepest puzzles we must face. Mathematics is based on logic.
      Starting from widely accepted statements, Mathematics use logic to draw conclusions and to develop complete Mathematical systems
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The work of Mathematicians may be divided into pure Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. Pure Mathematics seeks to advance Mathematical knowledge for its own sake rather than for any immediate
      practical use. Applied Mathematics seeks to develop Mathematical techniques for using in Science and other fields.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The boundary between Pure and Applied Mathematics is not always clear. Ideas developed in Pure Mathematics often have practical applications and work in Applied Mathematics frequently leads to
      research in Pure Mathematics.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Nearly every part of our lives involves Mathematics. It has played an essential role in the development of modern technology- the tools, materials, techniques and sources of power that make our
      lives and work easier.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      In everyday life, we use Mathematics for such simple tasks as telling time from a clock or counting our change after making a purchase. We also use Mathematics for such complex tasks as making
      up a household budget or balancing our cheque book. Cooking, driving, gardening, sewing and many other common activities involve Mathematical Calculations. Mathematics is also part of many
      games, hobbies and sports.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      In science, Mathematics is an essential part of nearly all scientific study. It helps scientists design experiments and analyze data. Scientists use Mathematical formulas to express their
      findings precisely and to make predictions based on these findings.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      In Physical Sciences such as Astronomy, Chemistry and Physics rely heavily on Mathematics. Such Social Sciences as Economics, Psychology and Sociology also depend greatly on Statistics and other
      kinds of Mathematics. For example, some economists use a computer to create Mathematical models use sets of formulas to predict how a change in one part of the economy might affects other parts.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      In industry, Mathematics helps industries to design, develop and test products and in manufacturing process. Mathematics is necessary in designing bridges, buildings, dams, highways, tunnels and
      other architectural and engineering projects.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      In business, Mathematics is used in transactions that involve buying and selling. Business needs Mathematics to keep record of such things as stock levels and employees hours and wages. Bankers
      use Mathematics to handle and invest funds. Mathematics helps insurance companies to calculate risks and compute the rates charged for insurance coverage.
